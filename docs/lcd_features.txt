LCD Output Features (how the screen will look)

- Dashboard mode (default):
  - Line 1: status summary, e.g., “Up 12:34  CPU 42%”
  - Line 2: bar graph for a key metric (CPU/RAM/disk) using custom block chars (0–5/6 levels).

- Bar graphs:
  - Auto-computed from `bar_value` + optional `bar_max` (default 100). Example: “NET 650/1000” renders a ~65% bar.
  - Optional label: show a short prefix on line 1 (e.g., “NET 65%”) with the bar on line 2.

- Alerts:
  - Backlight blink.
  - Line 1 prefixed with “ALERT:” or short message (e.g., “ALERT: Temp”).
  - Line 2 shows detail (e.g., “85C”).
  - TTL/priority keeps alerts visible and suppresses lower-priority updates.

- Scrolling text:
  - Any line longer than the display auto-scrolls (marquee) at a default speed; `scroll_speed_ms` can slow/speed it.
  - If scrolling is disabled, truncate with ellipsis.

- Custom icons:
  - CGRAM slots 0–5 reserved for bar blocks, slot 6 heartbeat, slot 7 free for sibling payloads.
  - Icons can be embedded inline via `{0xNN}` placeholders (e.g., “NET {0x00} 12.3Mbps”).

- Heartbeat:
  - A tiny icon (slot 6) can pulse or toggle to show the daemon is alive even if data is stale.

- Error/diagnostics:
  - On parse/validation errors, show “ERR PARSE” (or similar) and blink backlight.
  - Optionally clear or show “offline” on shutdown.

- Test pattern:
  - `test=1` payload writes “TEST PATTERN” on line 1 and a second line confirming backlight.

- Backlight:
  - On by default; can be turned off explicitly; blink on alert/error; otherwise stable.
